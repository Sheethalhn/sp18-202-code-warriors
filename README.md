## Game flow is being described here for everyone's quick reference. This will be updated as progress occurs.

Start page (Menu - world) - Start button starts the game level 0. Help button gives instructions tp play the game. Story Button gives background story for the game. 

Level0 - Collect heart crystal and build life, avoid health damage by avoinding the fireballs. Collect swords to fight enemies in next level. After a specific number of enemies occurence, the level ends and goes to new level. If health declines to zero before that time frame then game ends and player is given chance play again with same menu options as before.

Level 1 Welcome Page (level1help - world) - Start button will start the game level 1. It has menu options start, help and story.

Level 1 - Attack new enemies using swords. There are 3 types of enemies. Attacking with sword increases game points and reduces sword count. Not attacking and colliding directly with an enemy reduces health. Collecting stars (totally 5) make black panther to grow in size.

If health is zero then players loses, game ends and is given play menu again, If score reaches 300 then player wins and game ends.

When sword score reaches zero, Blackpanther is unable to attack with swords and will end up colliding with enemies and eventually die and lose game.
