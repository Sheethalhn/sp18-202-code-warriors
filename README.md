## Game flow is being described here for everyone's quick reference. This will be updated as progress occurs.

Start page (Menu - world) - Start button will start the game level 0. Help button will give instructions for level 0.

Level0 - Collect heart crystal and build life, avoid health damage by avoinding the fireballs. Collect swords to fight enemies in next level. After a specific time given to build health and sword score, the level ends goes to below page. 

Level 1 Welcome Page (level1help - world) - Start button will start the game level 1. Help button will give instructions for level 1.

Level1 - Attack new enemies using swords. There are 3 types of enemies. Attacking with sword increases game points and reduces sword count. Not attacking and colliding directly with an enemy reduces health. 

If health is zero then players loses and game ends, If score reaches 200 then player wins and game ends.

When sword score reaches zero, Blackpanther is unable to attack with swords. (He can choose to switch mode to level0 to increment sword score(in progress))
