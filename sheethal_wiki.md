**Week1** : 04/07/2018 -This is first week of scrum.Had a team discussion regarding game ideas and all agreed upon implementing war style game with Blank Panther theme.Discussed regarding the levels and braod scope of our game for the sprint and decided on using greenfoot platform.Target is to create small demo games in greenfoot  for next week to understand platform better.Team is facing dificulty in coming to a decision about game scope since everybody has different ideas in mind.

**XP Core value :Simplicity**  : It is very important that the game we develop is simple for everyone to understand which will in return increase productivity and also usability of game.So team decided to initially start with a simple level as everyone is new to the platform and it will take time to get accustomed to it.Team decided to start learning more about platform and patterns through practising simple game ideas uding tutorials


**Week2** : 04/14/2018 -Had a team discussion to futher get more clarity about the overall game.Spent my previous week in understanding the platform and patterns better.Went through tutorials to learn more about built in functionalities that couls be used for our game.My role for this week is to implement Factory method design pattern for randomnly creating different obstructions or enemies in the game to attach our hero black panther.Also I took up the work of implementing wireframe for developemnt and also simple use case specification developemnt to understand our target better.Started to read more about the pattern implementation scope to adapt it in a better way into our project.Team has not yet decided all the patterns that are to be adopted yet.

**XP Core value :Simplicity**  : This is second week of scrum and team just started with actual game development.We divided the level decided into simple tasks and took reponsibilities and roles among ourself.We have divided modules in a simple way so that each of us can work independently on our modules without much defficulty in integrating code.Everyone decided to use base platform set up by our team developer to start with and later integrate our modules.

04/19/2018 - Implemented Factory Method pattern by randomnly generating three different types of obstructions on the way of our hero Blank Panther.Functionality is working as expected.Need to work on few cosmetic changes of adding suitable background music and image files.

**Week3** : 04/21/2018 - This is the third week of scrum and I implemented factory pattern which was assigned to me last week and also came up with simple wireframe diagram to keep team in sync.Participated in team meeting and discussed regarding the progress of our game and pending use cases for the sprint.I took up the use case of attacking enemies by Black Panther to implement in coming week.Team is facing some integration issues as all developers are pushing their code to github and build breaks sometimes.

**XP Core value :Simplicity**  : Since team has started full fledged development keeping code simple easy to interpret and manageable is utmost important in this stage.Since team face some integration issues early in the week team decided to refactor code properly wherever possible to keep it understandable to other developers.Also team decide on continuous build integration everyday so as all the local dev repos are in sync.Also team decided to spend some effort on unit testin their code properly so integration becomes easy for everyone else and build remains stable.Also every time there is new feature added we decided to keep wireframe design updated so that team wont loose track

04/23/2018 - Implemented sword throw by Hero towards enemies on press of space bar and score gets incremented for each successfull hit.Functionality is working as expected.Planning to work on adding visual effects for attack to make game more appealing.

**Week4** : 04/28/2018 -As we are in the last week of scrum most of the functionalities have been developed.I worked on attack stratergy by panther last week and fixing few cosmetic visual effects,images and sounds for the game and also our game design is evolving as we get more clarity.Planning to work on polishing game this week and working on final touch up features of game to make it more appealing.And also on finalizing UML diagrams for final build.Team has resolved previous merge conflicts and build integration is proceeding smoothly now.

**XP Core value :Simplicity**  : Team decided to keep final 2 levels to maintain game simple and interesting for the user.Also team discussed about user's perspective and decided to design HELP menus properly for guiding users how to play our game.Also we have kept minimal keyboard controls to operate game to avoid cluttering and confusion to user.Team has tried to develop a simple yet addictive and visually soothing game for marvel fans.
