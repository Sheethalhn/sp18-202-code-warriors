**Week 1**
04/07/2018 Team decided the game idea to be a BlackPanther remake which would be a war style game. 
Came up with the look of the game with image for World and Image for Actor (Black Panther - hero of the game). 
Implemented the movements of the actor Black Panther.

**XP core value - Courage** : Keeping in mind simplicity yet have chosen a great game idea knowing it will require lot of efforts and creativity. We strive to achieve this by following - design and code for today and not for tomorrow.

**#Week 2**
04/14/2018 Team met today and assigned a design pattern for each member. I will be implementing State Pattern. Discussed the use-case with the team members in today's team meeting. Started self study and research to implement the pattern in our game.

**XP core value - Courage** : We have accepted the truth that we are lagging behind a little due to getting used to greenfoot functioning and learning how patterns work and which one each of us can take up. This gives us the clear picture about need of more immeditae effort to speed up the process.

**#Week 3**
04/21/2018 Created initial level for the game where BlackPanther has to build his health and weapon counts and escape from dangers. Level is functioning partially. Requires some more work which I will be working on this week. Discussed the progress in team meeting. Team also discussed about a final level, so totally there will be 3 levels in the game.

**XP core value - Courage** : Having multiple levels in the game seem like a big task but we don't fear anything because no one is working alone - we are a team.

04/23/2018 Made progress on level 0. Collecting crystal heart increases health score, while colliding with fireballs decreases it. Collecting swords increases swords count. BlackPanther is given a short time within which he can build up the scores and prepare for level1. Added welcome page for next level - level 1. Discussed the same in team meeting today. I will be further adding to the completion of level1 functionalities. Will be working on Activity diagram for the project.

**XP core value - Courage** : Team decided to add more functionalities within second level and not have 3rd level which shows courage to adapt to change whenever it happens.

04/27/2018 Added increment and decrement logic for health and sword score using extension of observer pattern used. Sword shooting will stop at sword score 0. Need to decide with team game end logic. State Pattern will be implemented accordingly. Added and changed object images as required.

**Week 4**
04/28/2018 Implemeted State Design Pattern for Game End logic. If health is zero then players loses and game ends, If score reaches 200 then player wins and game ends. Created State pattern class diagram and Acitivity diagram. Will be working with the team on presentation of the game demo. Will have a quick sprint retrospective meeting and document it.

**XP core value - Courage** : Team maintained persistence throughout the sprint and acheived desired results. We were stuck with a few issues for a while but overcame it with persistent effort to break through the issue.

05/02/2018 Made changes to State pattern to have restart/play game state when player loses. Changed images suitably.

05/04/2018 Final updates to project artifacts.
