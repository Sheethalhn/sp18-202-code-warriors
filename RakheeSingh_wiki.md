04/07/2018 Team decided the game idea to be a BlackPanther remake which would be a war style game. 
Came up with the look of the game with image for World and Image for Actor (Black Panther - hero of the game). 
Implemented the movements of the actor Black Panther.

04/14/2018 Team met today and assigned a design pattern for each member. I will be implementing State Pattern. Discussed the use-case with the team members in today's team meeting. Started self study and research to implement the pattern in our game.

04/21/2018 Created initial level for the game where BlackPanther has to build his health and weapon counts and escape from dangers. Level is functioning partially. Requires some more work which I will be working on this week. Discussed the progress in team meeting. Team also discussed about a final level, so totally there will be 3 levels in the game.
