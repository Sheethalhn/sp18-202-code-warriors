04/07/2018 Team decided the game idea to be a BlackPanther remake which would be a war style game. 
Came up with the look of the game with image for World and Image for Actor (Black Panther - hero of the game). 
Implemented the movements of the actor Black Panther.

04/14/2018 Team met today and assigned a design pattern for each member. I will be implementing State Pattern. Discussed the use-case with the team members in today's team meeting. Started self study and research to implement the pattern in our game.
